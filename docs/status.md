# Engineering pipelines

1. All data preparation, feature engineering and model (lgbm) training/diagnose pipelines are done
2. Model training (lgbm) can be set up with configs now
3. A manual updatable dashboard is set up to check the signal generated by lgbm model, for BTCUSDT perp data pulled from binance
4. Initial feature engineering and model training/inference pipeline is set up for HMM model 

# Modeling

Current modeling is based on 30 days lookback windows built for 1h, 4h, 12h and 1d timeframes, predicting a few different targets.

1. Tried to fit different targets with diffferent objectives (quantiles, huber, regression, classification, etc.), using lgbm model.
2. Forward 7 day log return prediction (from lgbm) showed promising results
3. Forward 1 day TPSL binary prediction (from lgbm) showed some useful results.
4. Initial HMM based on 1H features looks to improve the forward 1 day TPSL binary prediction's metrics.

# Strategy

1. Only tried a RSI based strategy, no other strategy set up yet.
2. A manual strategy is set up from 7 day log return prediction based signals (predicted logret > threshold, enter twap long positions on consecutive hours)
